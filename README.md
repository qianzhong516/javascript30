# Javascript30

Javascript30 is a course which demonstrates walkthroughs of 30 Javascript projects. The link is [here](https://javascript30.com/).

Here are some of my thoughts on the 30 projects. I have pointed out some existing issues in the original solutions and my own solutions, as well as some feasible extended features under each project folder.
